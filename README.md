Welcome to Cardio Vision, an innovative product that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect hypertension at an early stage. This README file will guide you through the installation process and provide an overview of the project.

About the Project
Cardio Vision is a project developed for the AIIMS Insight hackathon. Our team of four members designed and developed this product to address the problem of early detection of hypertension. Using an external lens and Machine Learning model, Cardio Vision predicts blood pressure by analyzing the images of the arteries inside the eye. The project was developed using Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Additionally, we created a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy accessibility.

Installation Guide
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the project in a Python IDE like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the main.py file to launch the Cardio Vision application.
Web Application Guide
To access the Cardio Vision web application, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file located in the web folder.
The web application will load in your default browser.
Upload an image of the retina to the application and click on the "Analyze" button.
The application will display the predicted blood pressure along with a heatmap of the retina.
Conclusion
Cardio Vision is an innovative solution that uses AI and ML to address the problem of early detection of hypertension. It won the AIIMS Insight hackathon and is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.
